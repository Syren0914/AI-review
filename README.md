# AI Review Summarizer

This Python script utilizes web scraping and AI-powered text summarization to extract and condense reviews from a specified URL. It employs Pyppeteer for headless browser automation and Google's GenerativeAI API for text summarization.

## Features:
- **Review Scraping:** Automatically collects reviews from a provided URL, including expanded reviews if available.
- **Text Summarization:** Utilizes GenerativeAI's advanced models to summarize collected reviews into concise paragraphs.
- **Customizable:** Easily configurable to adjust browser settings and API integration according to user preferences.
- **User Interaction:** Prompts user input for the review URL, providing a seamless experience.

## Usage:
1. Install required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Ensure API key is correctly set in `config.py`.
3. Run the script and input the desired review URL when prompted.
4. View the summarized reviews generated by the AI model.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pyppeteer
- GenerativeAI API key

## Example:
```python
import google.generativeai as genai
from pyppeteer import launch
import asyncio
import config

# Run the scrape_reviews and summarize functions...
